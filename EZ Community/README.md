# File descriptions

## Classes
Components for displaying class skill information. Skills are sorted by Class (mage/blademaster), Role (Tank/Damage/Support), and then by Gesture as it is a Virtual Reality game and skills are cast by hand movements.

## Map
This is a sample of the component that displays the world map and one of the filter types used in showing markers on the map. Map data was retrieved through an API call so it can be updated by guild members without needing to update the repo.
